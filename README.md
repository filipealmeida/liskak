Lisk Army Knife - Forging failover and command line lisk

:warning: <br />
After configuration, the following examples perform a donation to the address **8858064098621060602L** (hmachado):<br />

```./liskak.sh -s 10``` *# sends 10 LSK to 8858064098621060602L*<br />
```./liskak.sh -t 10 8858064098621060602L``` *# transfers 10 LSK to 8858064098621060602L*<br />

Thank you all and go Lisk go!

![LiskAK proposed setup for monitoring](https://github.com/filipealmeida/liskak/blob/master/docs/liskak_proposed_setup.jpg)

# Foreword
Last weekend, while educating a couple of individuals on javascript, they started asking a lot of questions on how to achieve many things in nodejs.

They wanted to have their lisk delegate nodes monitored, healthy and having at least one forging.<br />
...And then to check their balance<br />
...And then to transfer lisks from the command line<br />
...And then to check sync status<br />
...And then to list their votes<br />
...And then to vote for many delegates.<br />
...And then a lot of other stuff.<br />
<br />
The following script insued.

# DISCLAIMER
This script is immature and in need of many tests.

Nonetheless, since it proved it's worth and is allegedly usefull for the lisk community, here it is.

Pay close attention to the USAGE below, there are some flags that are self explanatory but not detailed in this README file.

Should you want features: ask! Will add it whenever I can.

Do as you will, have a delegation!

# Installing Lisk Army Knife
You'll need to have node version above v4.0.0 on the path.

To install node 4.x on Ubuntu:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Then, download the master from github and:

1. unzip liskak-master.zip
2. # Configure the file liskak.json in the liskak-master/src folder to reflect your account
3. cd liskak-master
4. npm install
5. ./liskak.sh --help

## Windows
1. Use the nodejs installer to install NODE + NPM
2. # Configure the file liskak.json in the liskak-master/src folder to reflect your account
3. npm install
4. liskak.bat --help

You can always run issuing "node src/liskak.js ARGS"

# Usage examples

### Failover forging and node monitoring
LiskAK running with the failoverMonkey flag will always try to have forging enabled at the best possible node using always forge tactics.
(https://github.com/4miners/always-forge)

***NOTE #0:*** Forging failover is under tests due to the poor scoring technique used in the past couple of weeks.
If you run into trouble, checkout 82ef27cb3f803693b466938852071dafb117fabc or use the code provided at https://github.com/4miners/always-forge

......
```

Additional usage of this can be found in the bundled scripts, `monitorMain.sh` and `monitorTest.sh`. These files include everything needed to enable forging monitoring.

Each script has an associated config file, `liskak_testnet.json` and `liskak_mainnet.json` in the `src/` folder. Simply add the delegate secret you wish you monitor to that file.
Then edit the monitoring script for the network you will be monitoring and include your hosts.

Example:

```
HOST1="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
HOST2=""
HOST3=""
HOST4=
CONFIG="src/liskak_mainnet.json"
LOG_FILE="logs/forgingMain.log"
pkill -f $CONFIG -9
nohup bash liskak.sh -c $CONFIG -f $HOST1 $HOST2 $HOST3 $HOST4 > $LOG_FILE 2>&1&
```

Using mainnet as an example, the script using `bash monitorMain.sh`. The logs for this will be found in `logs/`, this can be watched to see the monitoring in action.

### Supervision of node and automatic restarts/reloads
1. Fork 1: issues rebuild but requires work to do this only if you forged the last block (please open an issue with loglines such as this so it can be corrected)
2. Fork 2: issues a lisk restart
3. Fork 3: issues a rebuild
4. If "-B <MINUTES>" flag set, rebuild is issued if no blocks occur in <MINUTES>

Please advise for further rules by opening an issue.

Example #1: Lisk 0.3.1 and below, assumes app.log and lisk.sh under the folder provided

```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -S /opt/lisk
2016-06-03T17:09:37.562Z INFO Initializing
2016-06-03T17:09:37.593Z INFO Looking at the lisk log file "/opt/lisk/app.log"

2016-06-03T17:11:45.109Z WARN Performing "bash lisk.sh rebuild"
```

Example #2: If you have lisk.sh and or app.log on other locations, use the following flavour

```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -J /path/to/app.log -K /path/to/lisk.sh
2016-06-03T17:09:37.562Z INFO Initializing

2016-06-03T17:11:45.109Z WARN Performing "bash lisk.sh rebuild"
```

WARNING: this surelly won't work in windows; please donate to buy a copy :)

Example #3:

Additional usage of supervise is included in a bundled script `monitorNode.sh`. This script will automatically monitor your node and rebuild after 5 minutes using the default settings for lisk. In order to be used on mainnet the script will need to be modified. Please note that this script assumes lisk installation defaults, if your lisk installation is not default you will also need to modify those parameters.


```
RELEASE="test" <-- This needs to read main instead of test.
LISK_LOG="/home/$USER/lisk-$RELEASE/logs/lisk_$RELEASE.app.log"
LISK_SH="/home/$USER/lisk-$RELEASE/lisk.sh"
LOG_FILE="logs/monitorNode.log"
MINUTES="5"
CONFIG="src/liskak_testnet.json" <-- This should read mainnet instead of testnet
pkill -f $LISK_LOG -9
nohup bash liskak.sh -c $CONFIG -J $LISK_LOG -K $LISK_SH -B $MINUTES  > $LOG_FILE 2>&1&
```

### New account
If executed with the -N flag, Lisk Army Knife will produce a new key for you which you can use as an account.

Store it or add it to your liskak.json file to keep it.

If this flag is set, all other flags will use it.

```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -N
New account passphrase is: "you spike license country refuse barely turkey session online siege page broken"
xprivate: "xprv9s21ZrQH143K3zFueQ4cz5FwotnficAWw52YTmDxXTFLvH4aikwuRyAmyrZgrLvvguD3dZLroUBt7AzsM9RdPNftUdTnxgCWD5hjJzZbBdm"
```

### Balance and information
After creating your new account, produce a liskak.json file either on the src dir replacing it's contents or writing to a new file, like ~/liskak_new.json

It's contents will be:
```
{
  "secret": "you spike license country refuse barely turkey session online siege page broken",
  "host":"localhost",
  "port":8001,
  "proto": "https"
}
```

Now let's use the new file
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -c ~/liskak_new.json -i
2016-05-28T13:40:26.633Z INFO Initializing
Lisk account info for /home/someuser/liskak/liskak_new.json
   address = 1985049510400127319L
   unconfirmedBalance = 0
   balance = 0
   publicKey = 6625586ab0aeed824b83e9e1eff64694367eb51f80173852f13a10133c0aa985
   unconfirmedSignature = 0
   secondSignature = 0
   secondPublicKey = null
   multisignatures = null
   u_multisignatures = null

```
We're using the default from now on, so keep in mind it's the liskak.json file under the src folder "liskak-master/src/liskak.json"

### Transfering funds
If you have balance, you can transfer funds.

Transfering 1 LSK to an account, both commands below are the same:
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -t 1 18217073061291465384L
2016-05-28T18:25:36.223Z INFO Initializing
Transfering 1 LSKs to 18217073061291465384L
2016-05-28T18:25:36.498Z INFO Issuing transfer
   transactionId = 3519123441717401234


someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -T 100000000 18217073061291465384L
2016-05-28T18:25:36.223Z INFO Initializing

2016-05-28T18:25:36.498Z INFO Issuing transfer
   transactionId = 3519123441717401234
```

### Forging

Pretty much intuitive:
#### Check status
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -y
2016-05-28T15:46:43.919Z INFO Initializing
Forging ENABLED
```

#### Enable
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -W
2016-05-28T15:48:48.650Z INFO Initializing
   address = 81237192873981739812L
```

#### Disable
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -Y
2016-05-28T15:48:52.171Z INFO Initializing
   address = 81237192873981739812L
```

#### In case of error:
You'll see something like this:
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -Y
2016-05-28T15:48:45.382Z INFO Initializing
2016-05-28T15:48:45.913Z ERROR Could not get handle the response:{"success":false,"error":"Forging is already enabled"}
```

### Voting
You can compare your votes to your lists
#### List your issued votes
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -l
2016-05-28T15:05:37.961Z INFO Initializing
2016-05-28T15:05:38.438Z INFO Issuing listDelegates

92873422225441394187L;otehr
75395111111117926082L;hodor
...

```
#### Compare your votes with textfiles with upvotes/downvotes
Now you want to add some (upvotes) to your list or remove some (downvotes)
Produce a couple of text files (none required, but both possible)
1. One with the usernames or addresses (one per line) of the delegates you want to upvote, let's call it "in.txt".
2. Other with the usernames or addresses (one per line) of the delegates you want to downvote, "out.txt".

Now run the command:
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -l -C -I in.txt -O out.txt
2016-05-28T15:13:46.118Z INFO Initializing
2016-05-28T15:13:46.598Z INFO Issuing listDelegates

You have voted in 101 of 101
You will downvote 2
You will upvote 0
You may still vote in 2 delegates after this
You will have 99 of 101 votes from your account
```
The output is pretty intuitive, it'll list your votes and then report on your files, tell you how many votes you have now, how many, etc.

#### Commit your votes with textfiles with upvotes/downvotes

Just add the -A flag:
```
someuser@foo:~/liskak$ ./liskak.sh -vl -C -I in.txt -O out.txt -A
2016-05-28T15:17:46.118Z INFO Initializing

```

Please notice, LISK api aparently doesn't support downvoting+upvoting in the same requests.

Should the response indicate insucess, first downvote with the "-O FILE -A" flags and then upvote with the "-I FILE -A" flags.
